Sleeper is an app built with SwiftUI that helps coffee drinkers sleep better by asking them three questions.

The app uses a technology called Core ML, which is built into all iPhones, to make predictions about new data based on previous data it has seen. 
The app collects raw data from the user, such as when they want to wake up, how many hours of sleep they want, and how many cups of coffee they drink per day. 
This data is then fed into Core ML to get a result telling the user when they should go to bed. 
With billions of possible answers, machine learning comes in handy. 
Using regression analysis, the computer can come up with an algorithm that represents all the data, allowing it to apply the algorithm to fresh data it hasnâ€™t seen before and get accurate results.
